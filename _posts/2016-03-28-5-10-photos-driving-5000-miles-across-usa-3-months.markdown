When we left our home in San Francisco, we weren't sure where the road was going to take us, but we were dying to find out.

Before we decided officially that we wanted to sell all of our posessions and live a nomadic lifstyle, we wanted to dip our toes in the water a bit. So, we decided to take an epic 3 month roadtrip around the country so we could get a taste of what it was really like to live out of a backpack and to travel full-time!

Our trip took us all around this huge country of ours. We met some amazing people and had experiences that we'll take with us forever. We shucked oysters with the locals in Mississippi, cooked ribeye steaks with bonifide cowboys in Bandera, TX, snuck into an abandoned ghost town, and peered over the edge of the greatest expanse in the world, the Grand Canyon.

The Grand Canyon has to be seen to be believed. Peering over the edge and looking 6000 ft down just might change your life. Check out [that day's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQTUyZF_1f0) for an up close view.

We spent a lot of time in Texas and the sunsets never disappointed.

The beauty and epicness of Big Bend is hard to put into words. Check out [that day's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr3DnW5qyXE) for an up close view.

![Sutro baths](/images/uploads/allison-sutro-baths-san-francisco.jpg)
These once vibrant bath houses in west San Francisco have been reduced to ruins over the years. Check out [that day's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omOho20_RtQ) for an up close view.

The roads seem to go on forever over in western Texas.

![Sand dunes](/images/uploads/dunes.jpg)
These huge white sand dunes in New Mexico seem to come out of nowhere! Check out [that day's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCoXUeY9aKw) for an up close view.

![prada store](/images/uploads/prada-marfa.jpg)
This random Prada store sits outside of Marfa, TX, literally in the middle of the desert. So strange.

![mardi gras beads](/images/uploads/beads.jpg)
The aftermath of mardi gras in Baton Rouge, LA. It was an amazing party, but you wouldn't believe the mess these people left behind! Check out [that day's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM4zqlxLzEw) for an up close view.

![rock in atlanta](/images/uploads/stone-mountain.jpg)
This huge rock sits just outside of Atlanta, GA and offers the most incredible view of the city and surrounding areas. Check out [that day's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ajq61CuRE) for an up close view.

![looking out at new york view](/images/uploads/nyc-view.jpg)
The island of Manhattan is so photogenic. This was taken from the base of the Statue of Liberty, which offered some of the best views. Check out [that day's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMWr6azqyOw) for an up close view.
