Since we left our home and possessions behind 8 months ago, we’ve traveled to some amazing places and tried all manner of cuisine.

After an awesome week in Copenhagen, we decided to fly south to Berlin and spend 2 weeks really getting to know the city. Part of getting to know the city is getting to know their cuisine!

We wanted to try the dishes Berlin was known for. But, instead of just googling it, we decided to ask the locals! Most everyone we came in contact with we’d ask what quintessential Berling food do *they* think we should try?

We were given a bunch of amazing suggestions, but settled on the following three since they came the most highly recommended and, let’s face it, they sound delicious!

## Currywurst at Curry 36

As the name would imply, Currywurst is a sausage doused in a sort of curry sauce, typically served with a side of fried. And while you can find Currywurst all over Berlin, Curry 36 seemed to be *the* place to go for the best Berlin curry.

**And it did not disappoint!**

Be advised, this is not a dish for the calorie sensitive. Sure, every bite was a delicious cornucopia of flavor. *That sauce knocked our socks off!* But, when it was all over, we couldn’t help but feel deliciously bad about what we had just done.

This dish reminded us a bit of [Poutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine) - a famous dish from Quebec made of fries, gravy and cheese curds. Mostly because, while it tastes absolutely amazing, it should definitely be more of an occasional treat than a regular meal!

## Berliner Doughnuts

You know a city is badass when it has a pasty named after it! The Berliner (or Pfannkuchen) is similar to a doughnut, but with no hole in the center, typically filled with marmalade or jam.

Ours were filled with Plum jam, which caught us a little off guard. We had never had plum jam in a doughnut before (actually, I don’t think we’ve ever had plum jam!), so the taste wasn’t quite what we were expecting.

That being said, it was still delicious! It had a sort of apple butter taste to it and the bread was moist and fluffy. No doubt this is a taste that would grow on us if we lived in the city! Sadly, the calories would likely grow on us too :o

If you’re in Berlin, you’ve definitely got to give these unique little pastries a try. But we recommend getting two or three, each with different jams inside so you can find the one you like the most!

## Schnitzel at Scheers Schnitzel

While Schnitzel may be hard to pronounce, it’s easy to devour! We found a quaint, unassuming little schnitzel place under bridge in East Berlin called Scheers Schnitzel (try saying that 5 times fast!).

If you’re not familiar with it, a schnitzel is meat, thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer, coated with flour, beaten eggs and bread crumbs, and then fried. Yep, it’s just as delicious as it sounds!

At first glance, we expected this hunk of meat to be dry and tough. To our surprise, we were able to cut through it like butter and it was actually perfectly moist! It was also a lot thinner than we thought it would be. 

This dish took us back to our travels through Texas, where on multiple occasions we indulged ourselves with [chicken fried steak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_fried_steak). Schnitzel felt like it’s slightly healthier - or at least thinner - cousin.

Overall, this was an amazing dish to end the day on. If you’re in Berlin, you can’t leave without trying the Schnitzel at Scheers Schnitzel!
