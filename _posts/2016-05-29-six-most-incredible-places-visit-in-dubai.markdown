Dubai is one of the most modern and newest cities in the world. In recent years, Dubai has gained popularity as one of the top destinations for travelers. Can you believe that just over 40 years ago it was all desert and sand dunes? It is quite hard to imagine. 

Today, Dubai aims to be the biggest and best city on earth. Their goal is to make the impossible, possible. I feel so lucky to have visited this magical city and excited to share the most incredible places to visit in Dubai!

## Burj Khalifa

Dubai has created the world's tallest structure, The Burj Khalifa, which stands at 829.8 m. The 124th observation deck is quite a place to experience! The best time to visit is during sunset and night time to catch the beautiful skyline views. Another record-breaking attraction in Dubai is the Dubai Fountain located below the Burj Khalifa, which is currently the largest choreographed fountain in the world.

## Burj Al Arab

The Burj Al Arab is one of the tallest hotels in the world. It is a luxurious 5 star hotel and also one of the most expensive hotels in the world. If you’re a budget traveler, you can visit the hotel without having to spend a night by making reservations at one of their restaurants. 

One unbelievable thing here is the view from the top of the Skyview Bar! On a clear day you will be lucky to see The Palm, known as the man-made islands. A visit to the Burj Al Arab will also allow you access to an incredible private beach, which I enjoyed spending my time in!

## Dubai Desert Safari

A day trip into the desert was one of the highlights during my visit in Dubai. Here you will find the most incredible sunset! Take a day tour with a tour company to experience dune bashing, sandboarding, and camel rides. You can also experience more of the culture during a sunset dinner and show.

## The Dubai Miracle Garden

The Dubai Miracle Garden is one of the most beautiful flower gardens I have visited! It really does feel like a miracle when you walk through the garden. It’s not open year round though so make sure you check [the schedule](http://www.dubaimiraclegarden.com/visitors-guide/timing-rates/) in advance. Also, since Dubai gets fairly hot I suggest visiting early morning. I was one of the first visitors there and had the place practically to myself.

## Dubai Aquarium & Mall

As one of the largest malls in the world, the Dubai Mall will surprise you with how many things there are to do. There is a ton of shopping, endless restaurants, a cinema complex, and an ice-skating rink. And did you know that the Dubai Aquarium is also one of the largest suspended aquariums in the world? If you're brave enough, you can even dive in and swim with the sharks!

## Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque

The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque isn’t in Dubai, but it’s so breathtaking that I’m including it anyways! The Grand Mosque is located in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates, and is less than two hours from Dubai. I was amazed by this incredible structure, which is all white and beautifully crafted. 

This sacred mosque is very strict so I advise that you prepare before your visit. Women must cover their head, wrists, and ankles. Men are not allowed to wear tank tops or shorts, so dress accordingly!

When I entered the mosque, I was so impressed with the carpet. It’s actually the world's largest hand knotted carpet! The UAE is definitely known for the largest, biggest, and tallest things. While touring inside, make sure to look up to see incredible 24 carat gold chandeliers hanging from the ceiling! If only I could have taken it home as a souvenir :D
