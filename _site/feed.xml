        <title>These White Sand Dunes in New Mexico Will Blow Your Mind</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been sledding in the middle of winter and thought, jeez, this sure is super but I wish it was about 60 degrees warmer out so I wasn’t freezing my ass off and on the verge of losing my extremities to frostbite!!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the dunes at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm&quot;&gt;White Sand National Monument&lt;/a&gt; outside of Las Cruces, NM, are your dream come true! It’s a national park with literally 275 sq miles of warm, milky-white sand dunes that you can, and are encouraged to, sled down! Sound too good to be true? Well it’s not and for only $5 you can’t afford not to check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCoXUeY9aKw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-there&quot;&gt;How to get there&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park is located on Hwy 70 W outside of Alamogordo, NM, but we recommend staying in Las Cruces, NM. It’s a much bigger city with lots of cool stuff to do! As always, we recommend grabbing a room or house on &lt;a href=&quot;www.airbnb.ca/c/abieller?s=8&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; during your stay! (FYI: if you use that link, you’ll get $20 toward your reservation, even if it’s not for a NM trip!! Seriously. What are you waiting for?! Book something already! You’re welcome, we love you!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-time-to-visit&quot;&gt;Best time to visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, if you go in the middle of summer, the temperature in the park might actually be pretty hot. Like 100+ degrees hot. But as long as you get there in the morning or late afternoon and bring plenty of water, you’re good to go! It’s the desert after all, so temperatures fluctuate dramatically from day to night. If your schedule allows, we actually recommend going in early spring or late fall. The temps are best at those times and the crowds are minimal. We went the very first day of March and it was a perfect 77 degrees out. Plus we had the dunes all to ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-and-eric-jump-dunes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;allison and eric jumping the dunes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-bring&quot;&gt;What to bring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water and lots of it!&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a gift shop when you enter the park that sells food and beverages, but unfortunately there’s no water provided past the gates. And trust us, running up and down those dunes in the sun will make you really thirsty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunglasses and a hat.&lt;/strong&gt; The white sand, much like white snow, is brutal on the eyes. Plus you’re in the desert, and that sun is mean to foreheads, noses and uncovered body parts. And believe me, you won’t want to be reapplying sunscreen when your hands and face are covered in sand. So just buy a cool hat like I did and only worry about finding the biggest dune to sled down instead of your face melting off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-dunes-hat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Allison at the dunes in her hat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right clothing. In case you haven’t already figured it out, the park is comprised of sand. Never-ending piles of sand. Sand that can and will make its way into your eyes, hair, pants, shoes, pockets, ears, nose, etc. For that reason, I recommend wearing a tighter pair of underoos or pants to help keep the sand out of you know where. Also, only wear flip flops to get to and from the car. The sand is surprisingly cool and super soft, so set those little piggies free for the day. Plus, I don’t know about you, but I’d much rather have to wipe my feet off and shake of my sandals at the end of the day than try to get sand out of my socks and shoes. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sled and wax.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a sled, bring it! If you don’t because you’re in the south and typically have no need for a sled, that’s no problem! You can easily buy a used one at the gift shop for around $15. You could also buy a new one for a few bucks more, but we found that the used ones worked just as well as the new ones, especially with the wax… which I also recommend buying or bringing with you. It makes your ride so much faster and smoother!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of about the gift shop sled is that they’ll buy it back from you for a portion of the price. Just make sure you pay attention to the gift shop hours! We got there about 5 mins after it closed and they literally slammed the door in our face and locked it. Rude! So we left NM with 3 brand new and completely useless sleds…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. You’re officially prepared for the warmest and sunniest sledding of your life!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Ditch the Clutter and Travel Light</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My husband and I recently left our jobs and apartment in San Francisco to travel the world full time. Most people would agree that we’re living the dream, but full disclosure, it’s way more stressful and complicated than it sounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we made this decision, obviously we were super pumped up. But once that initial excitement subsided, we started thinking about what full-time travel actually entails and the reality of the situation set in: &lt;em&gt;traveling the world means living out of a small suitcase or backpack…and there’s no way in hell your entire wardrobe, shoes, home gym, straightener, lotions, hair products, and cats will fit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/the-cats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cats in apartment&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? First step, &lt;strong&gt;panic!!!&lt;/strong&gt; Next, take a deep breath (or many short ones into a brown paper bag) and focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tame-the-closet&quot;&gt;Tame the Closet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with your closet. If you’re like me, the majority of your shoes and clothing are sitting there waiting for that one perfect beach day, a birthday picnic in the park or the night when Ryan Gosling invites you to the Academy Awards because he finally realized he’s in love with you totally and eternally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically what I’m saying is, a lot of it is expendable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you go from hundreds of clothing items to just a few? By thinking practically. Traveling means a lot of walking around in new cities and airports so you’ll need comfortable and sturdy shoes that can handle the elements - dirt, rain, city streets, swelling feet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-your-footwear&quot;&gt;Choosing Your Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people think comfortable = boring, but I disagree! For example, I went with a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/innovation/free&quot;&gt;Nike Frees&lt;/a&gt; which are super lightweight, come in a bunch of different styles, and are perfect for workouts, travel days, hiking, city exploring, and lazy days working in coffee shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-hike-nike.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Allison hiking in nikes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flip flops are must-haves for showers and pool days, but can also be the perfect footwear for a warm day. In addition, I also recommend a pair of nicer, lightweight shoes (like these &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?vid=1&amp;amp;pid=597731002&quot;&gt;black flats&lt;/a&gt; for gals or these basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=37844&amp;amp;vid=1&amp;amp;pid=780357012&quot;&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; for fellas) that can be easily dressed for the occasional nice meal out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how much space you have, a pair of rain boots is also really nice to have (as I sit here writing on a rainy day in Montreal, wearing my soaking wet tennis shoes). Weight is always a factor, but apparently rain boots are super &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bogsfootwear.ca/shop/style/71287.html&quot;&gt;lightweight&lt;/a&gt; these days! So there you have it - style, comfort, and minimalism all in one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-your-clothing&quot;&gt;Choosing Your Clothing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to clothing, think about the different climates you’ll be in and go from there. Let’s assume you’re like me and traveling indefinitely across all different climates, since that’s the hardest kind of travel to prepare for in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s an easy secret: &lt;strong&gt;basics and layers&lt;/strong&gt;. Get a couple pairs of pants and/or jeans, shorts, and skirts that can easily be dressed up or down and don’t wrinkle easily. Match these with the majority of your tops and voila! Your bottom half is literally covered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I picked out all the bottoms I wanted and then grabbed tops that I could mix easily with them. For both guys and gals, solid and striped tops specifically are great because they can go with anything! If you plan on doing a lot of Instagramming while on the road and are worried about always wearing the same thing, I can assure you that people will notice a patterned top a lot faster than a basic tee. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maximize warmth and minimize load, invest in a couple long-sleeved thermal tops and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&amp;amp;q=3+in+1+jacket&quot;&gt;3-in-1 jacket&lt;/a&gt; to keep you covered in all climates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-your-accessories-and-toiletries&quot;&gt;Choosing Your Accessories and Toiletries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, now that your clothing’s settled, everything else is a piece of cake! For those who do it all - moisturize, exfoliate, tweeze, style, wax - you might have a hard time at first, but like I mentioned earlier, just think about the necessities. You can always buy things like face masks and extra razor heads on the road, so start out with small quantities and leave your bubble bath at home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that I highly recommend to help cut down on space are two in one shampoos/conditioners and a moisturizer that works for your face and body - I have super combination dry/oily skin and am in love with this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/solutions-Sweet-Almond-Moisturizing-ounce/dp/B0019LVFSU/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1459461866&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=almond+oil&quot;&gt;almond oil&lt;/a&gt; as a head-to-toe moisturizer. Also, I cannot say enough great things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drbronner.com/DBMS/category/LIQUIDSOAP.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Bronner’s Pure Castille Soap&lt;/a&gt;! It’s literally our body wash, face wash, shaving cream, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; laundry detergent all in one, plus it’s made with ethically-sourced, certified fair trade ingredients! It’s the stuff minimalist and hipster dreams are made of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re flying a lot and not checking a bag, an easy trick is to buy normal sized bottles of everything and then divide the contents into smaller, travel-approved bottles. Not only are you saving money by buying the regular size, but you also won’t run out of your necessities as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to your shampoo and soap, things I highly recommend having in your bathroom pack are tweezers, nail clippers with a built in file, ibuprofen, bandaids, a small tube of antibiotic cream, ear plugs and visine for travel days. I know it sounds like a lot, but they’re all really small items that can easily be shoved in a corner, pocket, or small toiletry bag and really pay off while on the road!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width: 65%; margin: 0px auto;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/ally-packed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ally packed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it! After 5 months of living out of a backpack, these are the tips, tricks, and essentials I’ve found that’ll take the stress out of packing without compromising on style and hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any great packing tips or recommendations? Let us know!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 Photos from Driving 10,000 Miles Across the US in 3 Months.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we left our home in San Francisco, we weren’t sure where the road was going to take us, but we were dying to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we decided officially that we wanted to sell all of our posessions and live a nomadic lifstyle, we wanted to dip our toes in the water a bit. So, we decided to take an epic 3 month roadtrip around the country so we could get a taste of what it was really like to live out of a backpack and to travel full-time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/road-trip-map.png&quot; alt=&quot;route across the usa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our trip took us all around this huge country of ours. We met some amazing people and had experiences that we’ll take with us forever. We shucked oysters with the locals in Mississippi, cooked ribeye steaks with bonifide cowboys in Bandera, TX, snuck into an abandoned ghost town, and peered over the edge of the greatest expanse in the world, the Grand Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/ally-grand-canyon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ally at grand canyon&quot; /&gt;
The Grand Canyon has to be seen to be believed. Peering over the edge and looking 6000 ft down just might change your life. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQTUyZF_1f0&quot;&gt;that day’s vlog&lt;/a&gt; for an up close view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/texas-sunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sunset in texas&quot; /&gt;
We spent a lot of time in Texas and the sunsets never disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-eric-big-bend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Big bend&quot; /&gt;
The beauty and epicness of Big Bend is hard to put into words. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr3DnW5qyXE&quot;&gt;that day’s vlog&lt;/a&gt; for an up close view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-sutro-baths-san-francisco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sutro baths&quot; /&gt;
These once vibrant bath houses in west San Francisco have been reduced to ruins over the years. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omOho20_RtQ&quot;&gt;that day’s vlog&lt;/a&gt; for an up close view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/on-the-road.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;empty road&quot; /&gt;
The roads seem to go on forever over in western Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/dunes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sand dunes&quot; /&gt;
These huge white sand dunes in New Mexico seem to come out of nowhere! Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCoXUeY9aKw&quot;&gt;that day’s vlog&lt;/a&gt; for an up close view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/prada-marfa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;prada store&quot; /&gt;
This random Prada store sits outside of Marfa, TX, literally in the middle of the desert. So strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/beads.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mardi gras beads&quot; /&gt;
The aftermath of mardi gras in Baton Rouge, LA. It was an amazing party, but you wouldn’t believe the mess these people left behind! Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM4zqlxLzEw&quot;&gt;that day’s vlog&lt;/a&gt; for an up close view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/stone-mountain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rock in atlanta&quot; /&gt;
This huge rock sits just outside of Atlanta, GA and offers the most incredible view of the city and surrounding areas. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ajq61CuRE&quot;&gt;that day’s vlog&lt;/a&gt; for an up close view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/nyc-view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;looking out at new york view&quot; /&gt;
The island of Manhattan is so photogenic. This was taken from the base of the Statue of Liberty, which offered some of the best views. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMWr6azqyOw&quot;&gt;that day’s vlog&lt;/a&gt; for an up close view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our road trip might be over but the adventure is just beginning! We’re heading over to Europe for the next few months, then we’ll slowly make our way over to southeast Asia. It’s going to be an amazing year!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 5 Best Coffee Shops to Work From in Austin, TX</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Austin, TX is an amazing town that’s known for great music, clean air and amazing barbecue. We’ve visited quite a few times and have slowly developed an affinity for this place. We wanted to see what it would be like to actually live and work there, so Allison and I decided to spend a week there working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t have any specific places in mind when we showed up, but instead wanted to just play it by ear and migrate from coffee shop to coffee shop each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a week working remote from Austin, here are the best coffee shops we found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cenote&quot;&gt;Cenote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/cenote.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;cenote coffee shop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we were unable to decipher it’s proper pronunciation, we found Cenote to be a great place to set up camp and get shit done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place has a great vibe and energy. Like many places in Austin, it was once a house but has since been transformed into a coffee shop, which gives it a nice homey vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit crowded when we arrived just before noon on a Thursday, but there’s plenty of seating so we didn’t have a hard time finding a spot to hunker down. They also had a small area where you could stand and work if you prefer.
I had a chance to try their latte, and it was super delicious. I only wish I had the time (and the caffeine tolerance) to try their whole menu! They’ve also got a little juice vendor outside on the patio. I didn’t get a chance to try it but they were plenty busy so I’m guessing I missed out on something tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlet wise, Cenote had us covered. Everywhere we sat we were able to find an outlet nearby. Once we were juiced up to 100%, we’d step outside for a little while just to change things up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; With tons of seating, great coffee and outlets-o-plenty, you’d be missing out big time if you didn’t check out Cenote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wright-brothers-brew-and-brew&quot;&gt;Wright Brothers Brew and Brew&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/wright-brothers.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;wright brothers coffee shop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending some time at Cenote, we decided it was time for a change of scenery, so we walked up a few blocks to Wright Bros Brew &amp;amp; Brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outside wasn’t much to look at but when we walked in we were immediately impressed with the overall vibe and decor. There’s a great industrial feel with a sort of rustic look. They’re even attached to a super cool record store, which I highly recommending browsing through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also happy to find that there were a decent amount of power outlets as well as plenty of seating. They had tall tables as well which are great for standing, if you were so inclined (see what I did there?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my favorite thing about Brew and Brew was the super simple beer guide. All beers are arranged on a grid, top right is dark and hoppy, bottom left is light and less hoppy. This made it super easy to find something that we liked.
I also had a chance to snag a mocha before beer thirty, which I found pretty tasty. I’d love the chance to sample more of their menu, but my initial impression was a positive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their food options were fairly light, but surprisingly they allow you to bring in your own food from outside. I actually noticed this same phenomenon at a couple of other places in Austin as well, maybe it’s a trend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Brew and Brew is a legit spot for coffee lovers and hard core remote workers. Inside you’ll find plenty of outlets, tables you can stand at and a great selection of beers. Unfortunately there’s no patio and the outside is a bit lack luster, but the unique decor and positive vibe on the inside make it a great place to get stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-buzzmill&quot;&gt;The Buzzmill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/buzzmill.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;buzzmill coffee shop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buzzmill is a great coffee shop, bar and barbecue joint, just across the river off East Riverside Dr. This place has everything a remote worker could need. In fact, we ended up spending the entire day there!
Inside you’ll find a ton of seating and a super chill vibe. The decor really was amazing. I sometimes found myself just admiring the artwork and random items strewn about. There’s even a quiet section where you can focus without loud talking or music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside you’ll find a ton of seating as well as a few power outlets so you can stay juiced up. There are also a couple of food vendors. We tried the barbecue and it was pretty superb. At night, this area transforms into a bar with great drinks and a live band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound awesome so far? Well I haven’t even gotten to the best part. They have a 3 hour long happy hour from 5–8, and guess what’s on the menu. $1 PBR! You have to be careful though. At that price you might drink enough to be transformed into a true Austin hipster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention it’s open 24 hours? I don’t even know how that’s possible! Seriously, this place has everything. If you’re in Austin, you’ve gotta check out Buzzmill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; With decent coffee, tons of seating, and a quiet study hall, Buzzmill is a remote workers paradise. Throw in $1 PBR and amazing barbecue in the backyard, what more could you need?
Cenote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cafe-medici&quot;&gt;Cafe Medici&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/medici.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;cafe medici coffee shop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending a few days in east Austin, we headed downtown to find some more great places to work. We eventually found ourselves at Cafe Medici. And while it had a different vibe than the quaint coffee shops of east Austin, it still had a charm all it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside felt very modern and well put together and there were more than enough tables to go around. I was also very happy to see tons of counter space, which is really important if you’re like me and prefer standing while you work. There’s also an upper level with tons more seating as well as a small patio area out front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had heard great things about their coffee, but at this point in the day we were already wired, so we opted for sparkling water and juice. Next time we’ll definitely have to give the java a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Cafe Medici has a super polished interior with tons of seating and plenty of counters for standing. Overall it’s a top notch place for digital nomads to get some work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;juan-pelota&quot;&gt;Juan Pelota&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/juan.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;juan pelota coffee shop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juan Pelota is a bike / coffee shop hybrid, created and owned by Lance Armstrong. Oh, and if you didn’t already make the connection, the name is an homage to Lance’s missing testicle. True story, I swear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testicles aside, we were really impressed with this coffee shop. Like Brew and Brew, they allow you to bring in outside food. In fact, they even recommended it! Their food selection is sort of sparse, so they advised us to grab something from the grocery store across the street and bring it in. On a side note, the store was a great little place with tons of organic options called Royal Blue Grocery, definitely check it out if you’re in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t say there was a ton of seating, but luckily it wasn’t too crowded so we didn’t have a hard time grabbing a spot. We found some tables in the back that had outlets built into the benches, which is super convenient and a huge plus imo. Other than that, outlets seemed to be fairly sparse. There were also some tables outside, which is always nice for when you’re feeling cooped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; While “Juan Pelota” may be a reference to Lance Armstrong’s missing testicle, don’t let the name fool you. This is actually a legit place to get some real work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s my list of the best coffee shops for remote working in Austin, TX. What do you think? Do you agree with my choices? Know of any other great coffee shops I missed out on? Leave me a note or hit me up on Twitter!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Travel Vlog: Exploring the Sutro Bath Ruins in San Francisco</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Who’s up for a swim? Well, back in 1896, the Sutro Baths were the place to be for the water inclined among us. Now, the ruins are all that’s left of this once popular and vibrant bath house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/omOho20_RtQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baths are located out near the northwestern tip of the San Francisco peninsula, nestled at the bottom of a large beach inlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first lay eyes on the ruins, it’s from the top looking down. The view is as beautiful as it is bizarre. Looking at pictures of the facility back in it’s hay day, it’s hard to imagine this vibrant glass house enclosing happy kids and families swimming around having the times of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-sutro-baths-san-francisco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;allison at sutro baths san francisco&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During high tide, ocean water would literally spill over into the baths, filling the pools. During low tide, there was a powerful turbine pump that would send 6,000 gallons a minute into the baths. At the time, it was the world’s largest indoor swimming facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baths were officially closed down in the 60’s. Ironically, the facility burned down in 1966. Luckily it had been officially closed down shortly before catching fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re visiting San Francisco, do yourself a favor and take a trip to the Sutro Baths. The area is free and open to the public and there weren’t many roped off areas so you’re free to explore the bulk of the ruins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Become a Travel Vlogger</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to be a travel vlogger, ay? I’m not surprised. I mean, who wouldn’t want to travel to exotic destinations, vlog their adventures and have millions of viewers wanderlust over their travels. It sounds like a dream life, but don’t be fooled, travel vlogging is hard work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, you don’t have to quit your job and sell all your possessions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm7a1IA7oQ8&quot;&gt;like we did&lt;/a&gt; in order to become a travel vlogger. Don’t get me wrong, minimalism is amazing and a worthy pursuit, but it’s not required in order to live a life of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where the heck do you even start? What if you have a full time job? What gear do you need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incorporate-travel-into-your-life&quot;&gt;Incorporate travel into your life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about “travel”, they are usually referring to expensive excursions thousands of miles away from your home. But there’s no rule that says you have to go far away from your home in order to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to a successful travel vlog is finding ways to travel, even to places that are close to home. You can visit parks, check out art galleries, take a train to a nearby city or drive to a neighboring state for a weekend excursion. Just make sure you’re getting out there! The audience wants to see a great story and you don’t have to travel thousands of miles to tell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most of us don’t have an unlimited budget, it’s important to keep your travels and activities cheap. Search Google for free things to do in your area or check our Groupon for cheap deals on fun activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-start-filming&quot;&gt;Just start filming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time a vlogger asks us where they should start, we always say the same thing, just start filming. It doesn’t matter if you’re hanging around your house talking about your upcoming travel plans or bringing the camera along while you visit a park with your family. The only way to learn how to vlog is to start making mistakes so you can learn from them. And the only way to do that is to pop the camera out and start filming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, once you overcome this initial hurdle, vlogging will become easier and easier. Eventually it will be second nature! So grab the camera, get out of the house and start creating videos you crazy creative creature!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-not-about-the-gear&quot;&gt;It’s not about the gear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vlogging is about 10% equipment and 90% story. Don’t waste your money by dumping it into expensive cameras and audio equipment. If people end up watching your vlog, it will be because of the great story you’re telling and the creative ways you tell it, not because your video was shot in 4k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-ELPH-160-Silver/dp/B00RKNMORM/ref=sr_1_5?s=photo&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1457768026&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;keywords=canon+powershot&quot;&gt;Here’s a simple little camera&lt;/a&gt; that is great for a beginner vlogger. If you can’t afford to buy a new camera, you can just use your smartphone. The camera on modern smartphones rival most entry level cameras anyways!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst thing you can do is sink a bunch of money into this new hobby only to find out it isn’t for you. Don’t make that mistake! Once you’ve built up some momentum and have gotten the hang of vlogging, having nicer equipment can give the vlog a polished feeling and make it feel more solid. But don’t jump the gun. Better equipment will only make your vlog marginally better. It’s the story that counts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started vlogging on a used Canon G7X, then eventually upgraded to a Sony a6000, which we also bought used. Check out one of our recent vlogs to get an idea of the quality you can produce with it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr3DnW5qyXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-do-it-for-the-money&quot;&gt;Don’t do it for the money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is no money. Period. Not for the foreseeable future anyways. It will take a crap ton of blood, sweat, tears and time (a whole lotta time) before you develop a large enough audience to make a decent profit. Even with 100,000 video views, you’ll only make an estimated $100-$300 profit. Getting the picture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start your travel vlog because you’re passionate about travel and want to inspire others to travel more. Try to have fun with it. If you’re not having fun, then vlogging might not be for you! Maybe try golf?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connect-with-other-travelers&quot;&gt;Connect with other travelers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do as a beginner travel vlogger is to connect with other travelers. Meeting other like minded people, whether online or in person, will help you feel like you’re not alone in this travel game. They can also be a great source of inspiration and drive you to keep traveling yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram and Twitter are great resources for connecting with other travelers. We’ve already met so many great people through these networks! We also make a point to interact with other YouTubers who have travel focused channels. It’s like having a bit of a support group and is a great way to find other YouTubers to collaborate with. Speaking of collaborating, it’s a hugely effective way to grow your subscribers. Keep in mind, though, that this usually only works with channels that have similar subscriber counts as yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully these tips help you get off on the right foot with your travel vlog. The most important thing of all, though, is to make sure you have passion. If you’re not passionate about travel, it will show through in your videos and you’ll likely not be able to keep up with vlogging anyways because you’ll get burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you think travel vlogging might be your calling, don’t be afraid to get out there and start filming. The first step is just turning the camera on and heading out on an adventure! Don’t wait until tomorrow, start vlogging right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for reading. I really hope it was helpful! If you’d like to check out our vlog, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEDrRCC0qRtPd5-sSa1hajw&quot;&gt;our YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;. We’re currently traveling the world and posting daily vlogs of our adventures. We’d love for you to come along with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why West Texas Should Be Your Next Vacation Destination</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Teepees, cowboys, unexplainable lights in the sky, and some of the best views of your life are just a few of the amazing things west Texas has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, all I knew about west Texas was that it comprised about half of the state and that El Paso was somewhere out there. I even lived in south Texas for a few years (shout out to the Rio Grande Valley!) and have visited Texas least once a year for the past 10 years and never once made it out past San Antonio. What the west might be missing in big cities, shopping malls or gas stations, it more than makes up for with quirky small towns, beautiful scenery and amazing photo ops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, if you’re heading to west Texas, you’ll need a car. I recommend flying into San Antonio or Austin and renting a car from there. But before you leave, you should probably spend at least a day in middle Texas drinking wine in the hill country [[link to our pic/post pic?]] and eating some delicious BBQ and Tex-Mex. I could (and probably should) write a whole post on the Austin area because I love it so dang much…but for now, back to west Texas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/wine-country.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;allison and eric drinking wine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now that you have your car and a full, I repeat a FULL, tank of gas (gas stations are few and far between out there), pop on your shades, hop on I-90, and experience the awesomeness of 80mph speed limits. Oh and make sure you have plenty of daylight when you leave, because you’re not going to want to miss this amazing scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/texas-sunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Texas Sunset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bandera&quot;&gt;Bandera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so Bandera probably isn’t considered true “west Texas”, but it’s definitely a good start for your journey. The self-proclaimed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.banderacowboycapital.com/&quot;&gt;Cowboy Capital of the World&lt;/a&gt;, the freakin world!!, is definitely the most authentic and adorable town. In Bandera, the deer roam freely, the beer is cheap, and the smokey bars are filled with denim-clad cowboys, live music, and line dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/s/Bandera--TX--United-States?guests=&amp;amp;checkin=&amp;amp;checkout=&amp;amp;ss_id=8s3f81ph&amp;amp;source=bb&amp;amp;s_tag=Ykvqc6ni&quot;&gt;The Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; selection is also on point and super affordable. If you want to a truly authentic experience, go horseback riding at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.juniperhillstables.com/&quot;&gt;Juniper Hill Stables&lt;/a&gt; like we did or spend a day on a dude ranch if you want a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.banderacowboycapital.com/contents.cfm?pg=places_ranches&quot;&gt;more immersive experience&lt;/a&gt; and then head to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.11thstreetcowboybar.com/&quot;&gt;11th Street Cowboy Bar&lt;/a&gt; on a Wednesday night to grill your own meat in the company of some truly fascinating Texans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/horse-trail-ride.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;horse trail ride&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marfa&quot;&gt;Marfa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cowboys aren’t really your thing, then your first west Texas stop should definitely be Marfa, TX. The best way to explain Marfa is to imagine an abandoned desert town that’s been taken over by hipsters and filled with random art galleries, delicious food, sketchy bars, and great coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, this town it’s worth the drive alone! While you’re there, grab lunch at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodsharkmarfa.com/&quot;&gt;Food Shark&lt;/a&gt; where super famous people like Beyonce and myself have frequented. Then walk through the town (it’s a short and flat walk, I promise) and marvel at all the random museums and galleries. After your stroll, drive about 20 mins down the road to Valentine, TX and take a pic at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prada_Marfa&quot;&gt;Prada Marfa&lt;/a&gt; so you can be as cool as me and Beyoncé. Then head back towards Alpine at sunset to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visitmarfa.com/lights.php#.VtkgAJMrL-Y&quot;&gt;Marfa lights&lt;/a&gt;. I seriously couldn’t have fabricated a stranger, more perfect town than Marfa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/prada-marfa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;prada marfa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our travel vlog of our day in Marfa to get a good feel for the town :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan ahead and have a little leeway with your budget, I highly recommend staying in a teepee or trailer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://elcosmico.com/&quot;&gt;Marfa’s El Cosmico&lt;/a&gt; campground - it’ll definitely give you the most authentic experience. Or if you’re like me and can’t seem to plan anything more than a couple weeks in advance, then definitely look for airbnbs in either &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/s/Marfa--TX--United-States?guests=&amp;amp;checkin=&amp;amp;checkout=&amp;amp;ss_id=3sy3sww9&amp;amp;source=bb&amp;amp;s_tag=l19obG27&quot;&gt;Marfa&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/s/alpine--TX--United-States?checkin=&amp;amp;checkout=&amp;amp;guests=&amp;amp;ss_id=0i6k6svk&amp;amp;s_tag=ZEnmtN4i&quot;&gt;Alpine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-bend&quot;&gt;Big Bend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day or two of getting some of the strangest instagram pics around Marfa, it’s time to pack up and head south for some &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/adventures/travel-vlog-hiking-big-bend-the-greatest-view-of-our-lives.html&quot;&gt;mind-blowing views in Big Bend&lt;/a&gt;. I unfortunately only had time for a quick day hike there, but you could easily spend a week or weeks in the area!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a quick day trip, you should definitely check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texashiking.com/Locations/ShowLocation.aspx?LocationID=1403&quot;&gt;Lost Mine Trail&lt;/a&gt; and just try to keep your jaw from dropping as you climb higher and higher. Pro tip: make sure to climb up one of the huge rocks at the top for the ultimate 360 views!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-cliff-big-bend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Allison cliff big bend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more time there, definitely check out several hiking trails and kayak, canoe, and/or raft the river. And if you’re super adventurous/masochistic with time and money to burn, you can do up to a 21 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigbendrivertours.com/7to21day.html&quot;&gt;day guided river tour&lt;/a&gt; covering the entire 231 miles of the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our epic vlog of our hike to the top of Big Bend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr3DnW5qyXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terlingua&quot;&gt;Terlingua&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either on your way in or out of Big Bend, you have to stop in Terlingua at least for a day to check out the remains of the Chisos Mining Company. Or if you’re like me and don’t necessarily love camping, it could also be your home base while you’re exploring Big Bend. Literally referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghosttowntexas.com/&quot;&gt;Ghost Town Texas&lt;/a&gt;, Terlingua is a fascinating glimpse into what old mining towns looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that unlike most ghost towns I’ve come across, this one is completely open and free, so explore and poke around the ruins to your heart’s desire! But watch out, I hear that some people have decided to go off the grid and have taken up residence in some of the old mining entrances and structures, so it’s probably best to do your exploring in the daylight. Then at sunset, head on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestarlighttheatre.com/&quot;&gt;Starlight Theater&lt;/a&gt; for some yummy and unique grub, live music, and a drink (or several) with the locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it! The ultimate guide to the least talked about, yet potentially most interesting part of Texas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been out to west Texas? What was your favorite part? We’d love to hear about it! Leave a comment below or shout out to us on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/the_endless_a&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Travel Vlog: Hiking Big Bend - The Greatest View of Our Lives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An amazing view can change the way you see not only the world, but yourself. It can challenge your perception by showing you how small you truly are. It allows you to see our planet from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we hiked the Lost Mines Trail at Big Bend National Park in southwest Texas. This land is as beautiful as it is desolate. It’s so massive that most of the time there isn’t another group of humans in site. It’s one place on Earth where it’s easy to feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like a front row seat to our journey, check it out in our daily travel vlog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr3DnW5qyXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we even got out of the car, our jaws had already dropped multiple times. The size of the cliffs and vastness of the canyons was hard for us to really understand. So mostly we just stared with our eyes wide, muttering things like “holy cow” and “where are we?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-view-big-bend.png&quot; alt=&quot;allison enjoying view at big bend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my wife Allison, the hike wasn’t much of a challenge. That’s no surprise when you consider that she works out hard for an hour a day six days a week. I, on the other hand, am still feeling the pain of the hike in both my back and my legs as I write this three days later. I should probably start exercising more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a mile into the hike, the trees opened up and we were greeted with an epic view of the road we had driven in on. It twisted and turned through the valleys until it disappeared into the distant mountains. Needless to say, we once again had to pick up our jaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then, a group of hikers crossed our paths and one of them muttered “You ain’t seen nothin yet”. And they were right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-cliff-big-bend.png&quot; alt=&quot;allison enjoying view at big bend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next mile was a cactus strewn, loose rock covered trek. It seemed that every quarter mile we stumbled upon a view that made the previous one seem like nothing special. We passed marker 18, then 19, slowly working our way to 24, which promised the greatest view of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the top, silence fell over the group. When you’re faced with this level of beauty, there isn’t really much you can say. You quickly realize that words will only take away from the experience. From here, you could see all the way into Mexico. It wasn’t a harsh divide. Instead, the two lands blended together as the mountains faded off into the hazy distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/uploads/allison-eric-big-bend.png&quot; alt=&quot;allison and eric at big bend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent over an hour at the top - it wasn’t nearly enough time. But life, with its pressing commitments and deadlines, has a way of pulling at you, no matter how peaceful you may feel in the current moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took one last gaze over the huge expanse that is Big Bend, then we made a reluctant yet well paced march back to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amazing view can change you. It can even be habit forming. After leaving Big Bend, we felt a craving for nature and adventure like never before. There’s something intoxicating about being that high up surrounded by such beauty and such certain death - one wrong step and splaaaat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Endless Adventure has only just begun, but this day will be a tough one to top. But we’re up for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for reading. If you enjoyed this post, I hope you’ll consider subscribing for more articles just like this one. You can also keep up with our daily adventures on our YouTube Vlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see you on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check out These 6 Fun and FREE Things to Do in Daytona Beach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When you’re traveling to new places, budget is always a huge factor. We recently spent a week in Daytona, Florida and we were determined to stretch our budget as far as possible. We managed to have a ton of fun every day without spending an arm and a leg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out these fun and free activities to do in Daytona, Florida:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stroll-through-dunlawton-sugar-mill-gardenshttpdunlawtonsugarmillgardensorgindexhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dunlawtonsugarmillgardens.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Stroll through Dunlawton Sugar Mill Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to check this place out because the pictures online just looked amazing. We weren’t let down! We arrived and were instantly enamored with the beauty of the place. The walking paths are lined with foliage and vegetation, not to mention curious squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://theendlessadventure.co/images/uploads/sugar-mill.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sugar mill gardens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place has an interesting history. There are a bunch of random dinosaur statues that are apparently remnants of a short lived amusement park called Bongoland. You can also take a stroll through the remains of the old sugar mill factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garden wasn’t very crowded when we visited. Just a few passers by. This was in January which is probably the off season, but we found it super relaxing and very photogenic. Definitely a must see spot if you’re visiting the Daytona Beach area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paid a visit to the gardens in a recent vlog episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/keej3nX1TEM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tour-the-angel-and-phellps-chocolate-factoryhttpangellandphelpscomtourshtml&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://angellandphelps.com/tours.html&quot;&gt;Tour the Angel and Phellps Chocolate Factory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all had a bit of a sweet tooth, so we decided to take a tour of the Angel and Phellps Chocolate Factory in Daytona, Florida. As soon as we walked in, they handed free samples to us. I tried a fudge bar that was literally called “Amazing”. And let me tell you, as the name implies, it was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We showed up around 2pm on a Wednesday and the place was rather crowded. Which isn’t much of a surprise considering that the tour is free and at the end they give out free chocolate! The tour gave us a fun, behind the scenes look at how they make all of their chocolate goodies from chocolate covered cherries, to chocolates in the shape of fish and seashells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the tour, you are able to pick a couple samples to try. I highly recommend the chocolate covered potato chips. They were so good it was stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;walk-the-daytona-beach-boardwalkhttpwwwdaytonabeachboardwalkcom&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daytonabeachboardwalk.com/&quot;&gt;Walk the Daytona Beach Boardwalk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were staying just down the road, we had to check out the Daytona Beach Boardwalk. Here you’ll find the usual boardwalk amenities: Huge hot dogs, rides, and crowds of tourists. We actually traveled here in the off season so it was manageable, but I’d hate to see how busy this place gets in the summer months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beach was great. Aside from almost being run over by minivans and jeeps (yep, you’re allowed to drive on the beach here. Weird right?). The sand was white and packed down, great if you’re looking to take a jog. The ocean breeze was light and cool. For the middle of January we all found it to be very refreshing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boardwalk is definitely a must-go. So next time you’re in Daytona, why not grab hot dog, hop on the ferris wheel and chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;explore-the-ponce-de-leon-lighthousehttpponceinletorg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ponceinlet.org/&quot;&gt;Explore the Ponce de leon Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our time in Florida, we were always on the hunt for epic views and photo ops. The Ponce De Leon Lighthouse did not let us down. This 175 foot tall lighthouse overlooks the Ponce Inlet beach. The views from the top were just amazing. We got lucky here too as we didn’t find it to be too crowded, but I can imagine how busy it might get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://theendlessadventure.co/images/uploads/lighthouse-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ponce de leon lighthouse&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it isn’t actually free to go up to the top, but at $6.95 for adults, it’s pretty cheap and worth the price, so we decided to include it anyways!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re visiting Daytona Beach, make sure you take time to visit the Ponce Lighthouse. It’s likely to be a highlight of your trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also visited the Ponce de Leon Lighthouse in a recent vlog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/keej3nX1TEM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visit-the-north-peninsula-sate-recreation-areahttpswwwfloridastateparksorgparknorth-peninsula&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/north-peninsula&quot;&gt;Visit the North Peninsula Sate Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve had your fill of tours and tourists, take a secluded and peaceful hike through the North Peninsula State Park. Parking is free and cars aren’t allowed on the beach, so you won’t have to worry about sharing the road. Plus there aren’t any tacky condos in sight which was probably our favorite part! Just pretty walking trails, sun-bathers, turtles, and blue herons. We also hear it’s a bird-watchers paradise, so if that’s your thing, make sure to bring your binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-out-the-casements---john-d-rockefellers-summer-homehttpwwwthecasementsnet&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecasements.net/&quot;&gt;Check out The Casements - John D. Rockefeller’s Summer Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Casements was purchased in 1918 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller&quot;&gt;John D. Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt; and it served as his winter getaway during his retirement years. He ultimately passed away there in 1937.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While quite interesting, the Casements is a bit of an anomaly. After Rockefeller passed, it served as a girls’ preparatory school for 20 years. After which it fell into disrepair after it was ravaged by fires and severe weather. It was ultimately bought by the city of Ormund Beach and is now restores and serves as a cultural community center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a price of free, it’s definitely worth checking out. And while much of the original substance of the house is long gone, there are enough pictures inside and interesting stories to read to make it a worthwhile visit.&lt;/p&gt;
