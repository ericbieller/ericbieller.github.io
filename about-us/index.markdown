We’re Eric and Allison Bieller and we’re here to show you that long term travel is a possiblity for anyone daring enough to take the plunge. We’ve quit out jobs, sold our posessions and left everything behind to chase adventure!

In our previous life, Allison was a recruiting coordinator for an online clothing company and Eric was the co-founder of a funded, remote-working startup. We were "living the dream" in San Francisco with our steady jobs, two cats and sunny studio apart.

*But something was still missing*

For years we had talked about selling it all and traveling the world. But, of course, every day got in the way. Isn't it funny how it has a way of helping you forget about your dreams so you can make more money and buy more shiny new things?

**Finally, we’d had enough.** We realized that life was living us instead of the other way around and we needed to make a big change. So we told our inner voices - you know, the ones that say you’re making a big mistake - to shut up.

In november of 2015, we got in our car and just drove. We left our jobs, our apartment and all of our things behind. We decided once and for all that we were going to *start living life, instead of letting life live us*.

After all, when your time here is up and the lights are going out, what are you going to remember most, the fancy sofa that looked so good with your IKEA rug, or the time you ran with the bulls in Spain or the time you hiked Machu Pichu?

**Exactly.** *And that’s why we just couldn't sit still any longer.*

We don’t have a ton of money and we don’t have any long term plans. We’re just going to take each day as it comes and make sure each one is an new adventure!

Don’t get us wrong, this was the hardest decision we’ve ever had to make. It’s a decision that twisted our stomaches into knots and brought on the most epic case of analysis paralysis. It was so hard to actually see ourselves doing this. But we eventually found the courage to make the decision to jump and just figure out the rest on the way down.

**Our goals with this experiment are really simple:**

*To share our adventures with the world and hopefully inspire others to break out of their comfort zones and travel more.*

*To provide [an intimate look](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheEndlessAdventure) at the lifestyle of long-term travel. From budgeting to planning to the frustrations of travel, we’re going to show it all.*
