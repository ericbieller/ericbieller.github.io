We’re Eric and Allison Bieller and we’re here to show you that long term travel is a possiblity for anyone daring enough to take the plunge. We’ve quit out jobs, sold our posessions and left everything behind to chase adventure and experience!

We had it all. We were both in our late 20s, had great jobs with impressive salaries and an apartment in downtown San Francisco. *But something was still missing.*

In our younger years, purchasing a new television or a nice car would have gotten us really excited. But as we’ve grown older, these items have slowly lost their allure. Eventually we were able to see behind the curtain of consumerism and the truth is, we were just trying to fill a hole inside ourselves with these posessions. But with each new purchase, the high quickly wears off and the hole actually grows bigger.

In november of 2015, we got in our car and just drove. We left our jobs, our apartment and all of our things behind. We decided once and for all that we were going to *start living life, instead of letting life live us*.

After all, when your time here is up and the lights are going out, what are you going to remember most, the fancy sofa that looked so good with your IKEA rug, or the time you ran with the bulls in Spain or the time you hiked Machu Pichu?

**Exactly.** *And that’s why we just can’t sit still any longer.*

We don’t have a ton of money and we don’t have any long term plans. We’re just going to take each day as it comes and make sure each one is an new adventure.

Don’t get us wrong, this was the hardest decision we’ve ever had to make. It’s a decision that twisted our stomaches into knots and brought on the most epic case of analysis paralysis. It was so hard to actually see ourselves doing this. But we eventually found the courage to make the decision to jump and just figure out the rest on the way down.

**Our goals with this experiment are really simple:**

*To inspire others to break out of their comfort zones and travel more*

*To provide an intimate look at the lifestyle of long-term travel. From budgeting to planning to the frustrations of travel, we’re going to show it all.*
